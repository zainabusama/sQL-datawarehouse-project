# SQL-datawarehouse-project
Building a modern data warehouse with SQL Server, including ETL processes, data modeling, and analytics.
Welcome! This repository serves as a Data Analyst Portfolio Project, showcasing my complete implementation of SQL.

This project demonstrates my proficiency in SQL Server and T-SQL, including data preparation, complex querying, data warehouse concepts, and advanced analytical techniques using real-world ERP and CRM data
# Tools & Project Setup
To replicate this environment and review the scripts, you will need:

Datasets: Access to the original course datasets (CSV files).

SQL Server Express: Lightweight server used to host the project database.

SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS): The GUI used to manage the database and execute all SQL scripts.
