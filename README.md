# SQL-datawarehouse-project
Building a modern data warehouse with SQL Server, including ETL processes, data modeling, and analytics.
Welcome! This repository serves as a Data Analyst Portfolio Project, showcasing my complete implementation of SQL.

This project demonstrates my proficiency in SQL Server and T-SQL, including data preparation, complex querying, data warehouse concepts, and advanced analytical techniques using real-world ERP and CRM data
# Tools & Project Setup
To replicate this environment and review the scripts, you will need:

Datasets: Access to the original course datasets (CSV files).

SQL Server Express: Lightweight server used to host the project database.

SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS): The GUI used to manage the database and execute all SQL scripts.
## 🏗️ Data Architecture

The data architecture for this project follows Medallion Architecture **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold** layers:
![Data Warehouse Diagram](docs/Diagram%20for%20data%20warehouse.png)

1. **Bronze Layer**: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV Files into SQL Server Database.
2. **Silver Layer**: This layer includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.
3. **Gold Layer**: Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.
